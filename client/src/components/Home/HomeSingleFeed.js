						This is my id card when I joined IIT BOMBAY for my
						masters.
						<br />
						1.Students are normal just like another random college
						ie. Bunking, partying.
						<br /> 2.Very high IQ level in problem solving as well
						as in grasping any concept.
						<br /> 3.Some people pursue their hobbies as well ie.
						Acting, dancing, sports.
						<br /> 4.All the facilities at the campus really really
						good. Ie. Cricket ground, swimming pool, gym matching
						world class.
						<br /> 5.I would say people here are very consistent in
						their curriculum followed by hardwork and discipline.
						<br />
						6.Even before graduation,they are getting highly paid
						for their part time offers ie. Unacademy, startup.
						<br /> 7.People are really good at their hobbies, I
						would multi talented ie. Guitar,painting, gymnastics,
						dancing, blogging, youtubing.
						<br /> 8.They are 5â€“6 years ahead in their life compared
						to average engineering student.
						<br /> 9.Spending four to five years here in this campus
						you can wonders in your career.
						<br />
						10. Unfortunately I dropped because I got an offer from
						psu, I spent around 4months there and I can say that it
						was the best time of life.
						<br /> few people from college i take huge inspiration
						from
						<br /> 1.Kalpit Veerwal jee main-360/360 founder
