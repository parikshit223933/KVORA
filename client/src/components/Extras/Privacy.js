							practices. You may elect to use information from the
							Linked Network to populate your profile on the Kvora
							Platform and help you find and follow your contacts
							on the Kvora Platform. For information on your
							choices, including how to disconnect a Linked
							Network from your Kvora profile, see the Your
							Choices section below. You may also elect to connect

						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Kvora Ads and Personalization</b>

							We may display personalized content (including from
							third-party content publishers) and personalized ads
							(including sponsored content), based on information
							that we have collected via the Kvora Platform, and
							through our Pixels, widgets, and buttons embedded on
							third-party sites. We also may report aggregated or

							addresses, phone numbers, or other contact
							information, demographic or interest data) in order
							to create custom audiences for personalizing their
							ad campaigns or for measuring the effectiveness of
							their ads; we only use this information to
							facilitate the particular advertiser’s campaign
							(including ad metrics and reporting to that
							advertiser); and we do not disclose this information
							to third parties (other than our service providers)
							unless required by law. We also do not disclose to
							the advertisers who use our Ad Services the names or

							successfully reached as part of such campaigns
							without those customers’ consent.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Third-Party Ads on Kvora</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							As described in our Cookie Policy, we may also work
							with third parties such as network advertisers to
							serve ads on the Kvora Platform and on third-party
							websites or other media (e.g., social networking
							platforms), such as Google AdSense (more info here)

							These third parties may use cookies, JavaScript, web
							beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other
							tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness
							of their ads and to personalize advertising content
							to you.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to opting out of tracking across sites
							by our Pixels (see Your Choices section below), you
							also may opt out of much interest-based advertising
							on third-party sites and through third-party ad
							networks (including Facebook Audience Network and
							Google AdSense). See Your Choices section below for
							more information about opting out of third-party ad
							networks.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>How We Protect Your Information</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							The security of your information is important to us.
							Kvora has implemented safeguards to protect the
							information we collect. However, no website or
							Internet transmission is completely secure. We urge
							you to take steps to keep your personal information
							safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping
							it private, as well as logging out of your user
							account, and closing your web browser when finished
							using the Kvora Platform on a shared or unsecured
							device.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Access and Amend Your Information</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							You may update or correct your account information
							at any time by logging in to your account. You may
							also make a number of other adjustments to settings
							or the display of information about you as described
							in more detail in the following section about Your
							Choices.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Your Choices</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							You may, of course, decline to submit information
							through the Kvora Platform, in which case we may not
							be able to provide certain services to you. You may
							also control the types of notifications and
							communications we send, limit the information shared
							within the Kvora Platform about you, and otherwise
							amend certain privacy settings. Here is some further
							information about some of your choices:
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Anonymous Posts.</b>You may post certain content
							anonymously, including questions and answers. In
							such event, your name is not displayed along with
							the content, and Kvora does not associate such
							content with your user ID and other profile data.
							For further information see how anonymity works on
							Kvora.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Your Content. </b>
							You may edit or delete the answers that you post at
							any time. Any questions you have posted may remain
							on the Kvora Platform and be edited by other users.
							Any deleted content will be removed from third-party
							sites from which it has been shared via Quora’s
							standard sharing features; however we have no
							control over deletions or changes to your content if
							it has been shared manually by others. When you make
							edits to your content, other users will be able to
							see the history of those edits in your profile
							activity and on content edit logs.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Adult Content</b> In your profile’s privacy
							settings, you can elect whether to receive adult
							content.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Emails, Text Messages, and Communications. </b>
							When you join the Kvora Platform by signing up for
							an account or creating a profile, as part of the
							service, you will receive the Kvora digest
							containing content that we believe may match your
							interests. As permitted by law, you are also opting
							to receive other emails and text messages from us
							that may be of interest to you as a user of the
							Kvora Platform. You can manage your email, text
							messages, and notice preferences in your account
							profile settings, under your Emails and
							Notifications settings, but note that you cannot opt
							out of receiving certain administrative or legal
							notices from us. If you opt-out of receiving emails
							and text messages about recommendations or other
							information we think may interest you, we may still
							send you transactional e-mails and text messages
							about your account or any services you have
							requested or received from us.
						</p>
						<p>
							Third parties may comment on your postings within
							the Kvora Platform. In your profile, under your
							Privacy Settings, you can adjust whether to allow
							people to comment on your answers and posts. You can
							also adjust permissions about who you allow to send
							you messages on the Kvora Platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Followers.</b>You can block the ability of
							another Kvora user to follow you by selecting the
							setting for this in the other user’s profile. You
							can change whether or not you follow other users.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Topics. </b>You can change topics that you follow
							or that your profile lists as areas that you know
							about.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Credentials. </b>You can change your credentials
							that are displayed in your profile or in connection
							with a specific answer.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Indexed Search.</b> In your privacy settings, you
							can control whether your profile and name is indexed
							by search engines. Changes to privacy settings may
							only apply on a going-forward basis; for example,
							your name (e.g., answers and profile) that has
							already been indexed by search engines may remain
							indexed for a period of time even after you have
							turned off indexing, as implementing this change is
							outside of our control.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Deleted or Deactivated Account. </b> If you
							choose “Delete Account” in your profile’s “Privacy
							Settings,” then all of your content will be removed
							from public visibility on the Kvora Platform, and it
							may not be restored by us, even if you change your
							mind. If you choose “Deactivate Account,” then you
							will no longer receive any communications from us,
							and users will not be able to interact with you;
							however your content will remain on the Kvora
							Platform. Once you deactivate your account, you can
							reactivate it any time by choosing to log in.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Pixels. </b>To opt out of tracking via the Kvora
							Pixels, please visit this page. Opting out of Pixels
							tracking may impact our ability to personalize ads
							and content tailored to your interests. This setting
							is tied to your cookies, and, unless you are logged
							in to the Kvora Platform, will only be effective on
							the browser for which you have performed the
							opt-out.
						</p>
