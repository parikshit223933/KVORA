						<p>Last updated: December 18, 2017</p>
						<p>
							Quora is a place that empowers people to share and
							grow the world’s knowledge. We believe if people
							don’t feel safe they can’t contribute to knowledge
							or listen to another person’s point of view. The
							following rules help everyone on Quora have a safe
							experience
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Be Nice, Be Respectful</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Follow Quora's Be Nice, Be Respectful policy
							(“BNBR”), which includes the following:
						</p>
						<p>
							Engage with Others in a Constructive Way
							<br />
							Assume everyone on Quora is here to make the
							platform a great resource with diverse backgrounds,
							beliefs, and opinions. It is OK to disagree, but
							please be civil, respectful, and considerate to
							other posters.
						</p>
						<p>
							No Hate Speech
							<br />
							Quora is a place for civil discourse and does not
							tolerate content that attacks or disparages an
							individual or group based on race, gender, religion,
							nationality, ethnicity, political group, sexual
							orientation or another similar characteristic. Any
							generalizations about these topics should be phrased
							as neutrally as possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							No Harassment and Bullying
							<br />
							Abusive behavior directed towards private
							individuals is not allowed. Repeated and unwanted
							contact constitutes a form of harassment. Content
							should not make threats against others or advocate
							violence, including self-harm.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Respect the Rights of Others</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Identity and Deceptive Activity
							<br />
							Your Quora profile should use your real name or
							legally incorporated business name and use accurate
							and truthful credentials. Do not use Quora to
							impersonate another person, act as another entity
							without authorization, or create multiple accounts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Intellectual Property and Personal Rights
							<br />
							Do not post content that infringes any intellectual
							property or personal right of another party. Writing
							taken from another source should be properly
							attributed and block quoted. Learn More.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Respect the Quora Platform</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							No Spam
							<br />
							Do not use Quora to post or attract spam. Learn More
						</p>
						<p>
							No Malicious or Illegal Activity
							<br />
							Do not contribute viruses, malware, and other
							malicious programs or engage in activity that harms
							or interferes with the operation of Quora or seeks
							to circumvent security or authentication measures.
							Do not use Quora to engage in unlawful or fraudulent
							activity, or to promote illegal acts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Abide by Other Quora Policies
							<br />
							Follow Quora's other policies, which Quora may add
							or change from time to time. Learn more
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Reporting Problems</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							If you see something on Quora that you believe
							violates our guidelines or policies, please report
							it to us using the in-product reporting tool, or via
							our contact form.
						</p>
						<p>
							Violating the Acceptable Use Policy may result in
							the removal of content, or in the limitation or
							termination of a user’s access to Quora. Learn More
